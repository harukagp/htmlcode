<h2>Abilities</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Soft skills, or interpersonal skills, make up your personality and personal attributes. <br>
        They are always present but more difficult to prove, unlike hard skills, <br>
        which are quantifiable and teachable.</li>
    <li>Soft skills may not necessarily make you qualified for more jobs. <br>
        Still, they help you perform the job more effectively and are valuable for team contribution and management.
